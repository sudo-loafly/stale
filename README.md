## Learning the `Stale` Programming Language
To use Stale in a professional example, it's essential to grasp the basics!

```js
(?main=go _class +++ ? === typeof(int::StorageByte)):
  class main_ln_string(){
    var _func discover_data()[
      this.testCookie.test()
      this.testCookie.status()
      this.testCookie.end()
    discover_data()
    let type = this.dataType !++ this.webUI
```
